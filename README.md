# Template project

This is a template for Linux/GCC/C++ projects. The structure is optimized for
use with VSCode but can also be used stand alone. By default this is set for a
C++11 project.

This readme and the associated documentation are also templates in addition of
being a user manual of the Makefile and VSCode features.
